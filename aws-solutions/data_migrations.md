## How to migrate data from legacy to AWS?
AWS provides many services(both self service and professionally managed) to help in migration of data from legacy environments to AWS env.

- **AWS Database Migration Service(AWS DMS):**
    This self-service helps to move data from one DB engine to another. Also the data replication can set to be done on an ongoing basis.

- **AWS Schema Conversion Tool(AWS SCT):**
    This self-service helps to handle the difference between the schema of various DB types. Converts stored procs, views, tables etc.
